# Zero Trust Network Architecture

## Overview

This document describes the architecture of the Zero Trust Network implementation, detailing how each component works together to provide comprehensive network security based on the principle of "never trust, always verify."

## Core Principles

### 1. Zero Trust Philosophy
- **Never Trust, Always Verify**: Every request is authenticated and authorized
- **Least Privilege Access**: Users and devices receive minimum required access
- **Assume Breach**: Architecture assumes the network is already compromised
- **Verify Explicitly**: Use all available data points for access decisions

### 2. Defense in Depth
- Multiple security layers working in concert
- Redundant controls to prevent single points of failure
- Continuous monitoring and adaptive response

## Architecture Components

  - WireGuard-based encrypted connections
  - Traffic forwarding and routing
  - Connection monitoring and metrics

#### SDP Client
- **Location**: `sdp/client/`

  - Health status reporting
  - Administrative interface

## Data Flow Architecture

### Authentication Flow
1. User initiates connection through SDP Client
2. Client collects device compliance information
3. Authentication request sent to SDP Controller
4. Controller validates credentials and device status
5. NAC service evaluates device compliance
6. PKI validates device certificates
7. Access token issued for compliant devices

### Access Request Flow
1. User requests access to network resource
2. Integration API orchestrates evaluation across components
3. Micro-segmentation engine evaluates network policies
4. NAC service confirms device compliance
5. SDP Controller authorizes specific access
6. SDP Gateway creates encrypted tunnel
7. Traffic flows through monitored tunnel

### Policy Enforcement Flow
1. Unified policies created through Integration API
2. Policies distributed to relevant components
3. Real-time traffic evaluation against policies
4. Violations trigger automated responses
5. Events logged and analyzed for patterns

## Security Architecture

### Encryption
- **Transport**: TLS 1.3 for all API communications
- **VPN Tunnels**: WireGuard with ChaCha20Poly1305
- **Certificates**: RSA 2048-bit minimum, SHA-256 signatures
- **Storage**: AES-256 for sensitive data at rest

### Authentication
- **Multi-factor**: Required for administrative access
- **Certificate-based**: PKI certificates for device authentication
- **Token-based**: JWT tokens for session management
- **Continuous**: Ongoing validation throughout session

### Authorization
- **Role-based**: User roles determine base permissions
- **Attribute-based**: Context-aware access decisions
- **Risk-based**: Access levels based on compliance status
- **Time-based**: Session duration limits based on risk

## High Availability

### Service Redundancy
- All components designed for horizontal scaling
- Health monitoring with automatic failover
- Load balancing across service instances
- Graceful degradation on component failure

### Data Persistence
- SQLite databases for development/demo
- PostgreSQL for production deployments
- Redis for session and cache data
- Automated backup and recovery procedures

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Metrics Collection
- Real-time performance metrics
- Security event correlation
- Compliance status tracking
- Network traffic analysis

### Alert Categories
- **Critical**: Service failures, security breaches
- **Warning**: Policy violations, compliance issues
- **Info**: Normal operations, successful authentications

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- Microservices architecture enables independent scaling
- Container-based deployment with orchestration
- API gateway for load distribution
- Database sharding for large deployments

### Performance Optimization
- Connection pooling for database access
- Caching for frequently accessed data
- Asynchronous processing for non-critical operations
- Efficient certificate validation and caching

## Integration Points

### External Systems

- SIEM system integration
- Vulnerability scanners
- Endpoint protection platforms

### APIs
- RESTful APIs for all components
