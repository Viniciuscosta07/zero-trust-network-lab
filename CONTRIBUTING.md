## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style

#### Python Code
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Maximum line length: 88 characters (Black formatter)
- Use meaningful variable and function names

```python
# Good
def evaluate_device_compliance(device_info: Dict[str, Any]) -> ComplianceResult:
    """Evaluate device against compliance policies."""
    pass

# Avoid
def eval_dev(d):
    pass
```

#### JavaScript/Node.js Code
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use ES6+ features appropriately
- Prefer `const` over `let`, avoid `var`
- Use meaningful variable names

```javascript
// Good
const authenticateUser = async (credentials) => {
    // Implementation
};

// Avoid
const auth = (c) => {
    // Implementation
};
```

#### Documentation
- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples where helpful
- Document all API endpoints
- Explain security implications

### Security Guidelines

#### Code Security
- Never commit secrets, keys, or passwords

- Use TLS for all network communications
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Document network security architecture

### Testing Requirements

#### Unit Tests
- Write tests for all new functionality
- Maintain minimum 80% code coverage
- Test both success and failure cases
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

#### Integration Tests
- Test component interactions
- Verify API contracts
- Test security policy enforcement
- Validate certificate operations

#### Security Tests
