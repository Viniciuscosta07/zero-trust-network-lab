## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### ðŸš¨ DO NOT
- **Create public GitHub issues** for security vulnerabilities
- **Post on social media** or public forums
- **Share exploit details** publicly before coordination
- **Use the vulnerability** to harm others or systems

### âœ… DO
- **Report privately** using the methods below
- **Provide detailed information** about the vulnerability
- **Allow reasonable time** for us to respond and fix
- **Follow responsible disclosure** practices

## How to Report

### Primary Method: Email
Send details to: **security@zerotrust-lab.org**

### Alternative Method: GitHub Security Advisories
1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/bunnyhp/zero-trust-network-lab/security) in this repository
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the security advisory form

## What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

### Vulnerability Details
- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and affected components
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
- **Affected versions**: Which versions are affected
- **Exploit code**: If available, include proof-of-concept code

### Contact Information

### Example Report
```
Subject: Security Vulnerability in SDP Controller Authentication

Description:
The SDP Controller's JWT token validation has a timing attack vulnerability
that could allow attackers to bypass authentication.

Impact:
- Unauthorized access to zero trust network resources
- Potential privilege escalation
- Bypass of security policies

Reproduction:
1. Start the SDP Controller
2. Send malformed JWT tokens with timing analysis
3. Observe timing differences in validation responses

Affected Versions:
- All versions 1.0.0 and earlier

Proof of Concept:
[Include exploit code if available]

Contact: security-researcher@example.com
```

## Response Timeline

We commit to the following response timeline:

| Timeframe | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| **24 hours** | Acknowledge receipt of vulnerability report |
| **72 hours** | Initial assessment and severity classification |
| **7 days** | Detailed analysis and fix development |
| **30 days** | Security patch release (for critical/high severity) |
| **90 days** | Public disclosure (coordinated with reporter) |

## Severity Classification

We use the following severity levels:

### ðŸ”´ Critical
- Remote code execution
- Authentication bypass
- Privilege escalation
- Data exfiltration

### ðŸŸ  High
- Information disclosure
- Denial of service
- Local privilege escalation
- Cryptographic weaknesses

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium
- Limited information disclosure
- Performance impact
- Configuration issues
- Input validation problems

### ðŸŸ¢ Low
- Minor information leakage
- Cosmetic issues
- Documentation errors
- Non-exploitable bugs

## Security Measures

### Code Security
- **Static Analysis**: Automated security scanning with Bandit and ESLint
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular vulnerability checks with Safety
- **Code Review**: All changes require security review
- **Secure Defaults**: All configurations use secure defaults

### Infrastructure Security
- **Container Security**: Regular base image updates
- **Network Isolation**: Services run in isolated networks
- **Secret Management**: No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- **Access Control**: Principle of least privilege

### Development Security
- **Secure Coding**: Following OWASP guidelines
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without information disclosure
- **Logging**: Comprehensive audit logging without sensitive data

## Security Best Practices

### For Users
- **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version
- **Secure Configuration**: Follow security configuration guides
- **Network Security**: Implement proper network segmentation
- **Monitoring**: Enable security monitoring and alerting
- **Access Control**: Use strong authentication and authorization

### For Developers
- **Security Review**: All code changes require security review
