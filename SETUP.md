## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create `.env` file to customize configuration:
```bash
# Security
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-secure-secret-key
SDP_JWT_SECRET=your-sdp-secret-key

# Database
POSTGRES_DB=zerotrust
POSTGRES_USER=ztuser
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your-secure-password

# Service Configuration
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
METRICS_RETENTION_DAYS=30
SESSION_TIMEOUT=28800

# PKI Settings
CA_NAME=YourOrg-Root-CA
CERT_VALIDITY_DAYS=365
RENEWAL_THRESHOLD_DAYS=30
```

### Custom Policies
Add custom access policies via the API or dashboard:
```json
{
  "name": "Allow DevOps SSH Access",
  "source_zone": "management",
  "destination_zone": "servers",
  "protocol": "tcp",
  "port_range": "22",
  "action": "allow",
  "conditions": {
    "require_mfa": true,
    "business_hours_only": false,
    "max_session_duration": 7200
  }
}
```

### Network Zones
Customize network zones in `config/network/zones.json`:
```json
{
  "zones": {
    "custom_zone": {
      "name": "Custom Application Zone",
      "subnet": "10.7.0.0/24",
      "security_level": "high",
      "description": "Custom application servers"
    }
  }
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Configuration

### SSL/TLS Certificates
For production deployment:
```bash
# Generate proper certificates
openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes \
  -out config/ssl/server.crt \
  -keyout config/ssl/server.key \
  -subj "/CN=your-domain.com"

# Update docker-compose.yml with SSL configuration
```

### High Availability Setup
```yaml
# docker-compose.ha.yml
services:
  sdp-controller:
    deploy:
      replicas: 3
      restart_policy:
        condition: on-failure
        delay: 5s
        max_attempts: 3
  
  postgres:
    image: postgres:15-alpine
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_REPLICATION_MODE=master
      - POSTGRES_REPLICATION_USER=replicator
```

### External Integrations
- **LDAP/Active Directory**: Configure user authentication
- **SIEM Integration**: Forward security events
- **Vulnerability Scanners**: Import compliance data
- **Endpoint Protection**: Integrate device security status

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Services Won't Start
```bash
# Check Docker status
docker-compose ps

# View service logs
docker-compose logs service-name

# Restart specific service
docker-compose restart service-name
```

#### Authentication Failures
```bash
# Reset admin user
docker-compose exec sdp-controller python reset_admin.py

# Check JWT configuration
docker-compose logs sdp-controller | grep JWT
```

#### Network Connectivity Issues
```bash
# Test inter-service communication
docker-compose exec integration-api curl http://sdp-controller:8001/health

# Check WireGuard status
docker-compose exec sdp-gateway wg show
```

### Log Analysis
```bash
# Collect all logs for analysis
docker-compose logs > system_logs.txt

# Search for specific issues
grep -i "error\|fail\|exception" system_logs.txt

# Monitor real-time logs
docker-compose logs -f
```
