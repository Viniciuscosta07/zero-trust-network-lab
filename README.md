# Zero Trust Network Implementation Lab

A comprehensive, lightweight implementation of zero trust network architecture principles for educational and demonstration purposes.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This project implements the three core pillars of zero trust networking:

1. **Software-Defined Perimeter (SDP)** - Dynamic, encrypted tunnels with "dark network" approach
2. **Micro-Segmentation** - Network isolation with granular access controls
3. **Continuous Verification** - Ongoing authentication and compliance monitoring
